# immunity.yml
# Prevent bounties from being set on you.

# players can buy immunity from having bounties set on them as opposed to having immunity from the permission node notbounties.immune
# Immunity types:
# DISABLE
# PERMANENT
# SCALING
# TIME
type: SCALING

# Allow the notbounties.immune and other immunity permissions to give a player immunity.
# Note: Anyone with the * permission will also have this. Fix: https://github.com/No-Not-Jaden/NotBounties/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-make-operatorsadmins-not-immune-to-bounties

# this immunity type will never run out
permanent-immunity:
  cost: 128

# this immunity type will be stronger the more money you spend - only if permanent immunity is disabled
# if you buy immunity for 2500, then it protects you from bounties set for 2500, 2499, 1500, etc. (with ratio set to 1)
# bounties can be set on you for 2501 and higher
scaling-immunity:
  # money spent -> bounty protection
  # ex: if ratio is 0.5, buying immunity for 1000 will protect you from bounties 500 or less
  ratio: 1.0

# this immunity type will only last for a period of time
time-immunity:
  # how many seconds 1 currency will add to your immunity
  # ex: spending $15 with seconds: 3600 will give you 54000 seconds of immunity, or 15 hours
  seconds: 3600
  # time will count down while players are offline
  offline-tracking: true

# in SECONDS how long before a player can set a bounty on a player that was just killed with a bounty
